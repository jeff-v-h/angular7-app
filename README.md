# Ng7

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6, using the command:
`ng new ng7 --style=scss`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
For shortcut run `ng serve -o` to automatically open browser window.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` (`ng g c component-name` for short) to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

eg. To create a component named "about": `ng g c about`

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build as seen below:

1. From project root run `ng build --prod`
2. `cd dist/<project name>`
3. `npm install http-server -g` to install http-server globally if not already installed
4. `http-server -o` to open production version

## Running unit tests

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
